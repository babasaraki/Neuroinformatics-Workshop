| Audience | Computational skills required | Duration |
:----------|:---------------|:----------|
| Biologists | [Introduction to the Unix Command Line](https://cambiotraining.github.io/unix-shell/) | 2 hour workshop (~2 hours of trainer-led time)|

## Overview
This workshop, titled "Introduction to Neuroinformatics", is designed to provide participants with a foundational understanding of bioinformatics as applied to neuroscience. Over the course of two hours, attendees will be introduced to key concepts in neuroinformatics, including neurotranscriptomics, data preprocessing, and the integration of brain imaging data. The session will combine theoretical knowledge with practical demonstrations to equip participants with the skills needed to analyze and interpret complex neuroinformatics data.

## Audience
This workshop is aimed at graduate students, early-career researchers, and professionals in the fields of neuroscience, bioinformatics, and computational biology. It is particularly suited for those who are interested in applying bioinformatics techniques to neurological data and wish to expand their knowledge of neuroinformatics tools and methodologies.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

- Understand the basic principles of bioinformatics and how they apply to neuroinformatics.
- Explain the concept of neurotranscriptomics and its relevance to neuroscience research.
- Perform basic preprocessing steps for neuroinformatics data, including both transcriptomics and brain imaging data.
- Integrate and analyze brain imaging data using neuroinformatics tools and techniques.
- Access and navigate relevant neuroinformatics resources and databases.

> These materials are designed for both instructor-led workshops and for learners to use on their own.

## Prerequisites
Participants should have a basic understanding of biology, particularly in neuroscience or molecular biology. Familiarity with general bioinformatics concepts and tools, such as sequence alignment and data analysis, will be beneficial but is not mandatory. Prior experience with coding in Python or R is recommended for the practical components of the workshop.

## Application
This workshop will have immediate application for those working in the field of neuroscience or related areas, providing tools and knowledge that can be applied to the analysis of complex neuroinformatics data. Participants will leave with practical skills in data preprocessing and analysis that can be directly used in their research projects or professional work. The workshop will also serve as a foundation for further exploration of advanced neuroinformatics techniques.
